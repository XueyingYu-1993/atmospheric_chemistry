We study the coupled interactions across biogenic/anthropogenic emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and the broader climate. One example work is diagnosing the _[temperature dependence of methane emissions](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/3325/2023/)_, and evaluating the sensitivity of the global methane budget to atmospheric oxidation.
