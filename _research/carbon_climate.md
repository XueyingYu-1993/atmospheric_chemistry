We study the coupled interactions across biogenic/anthropogenic emissions, atmospheric chemistry, and the broader climate. <br><br>
One example work is diagnosing the [temperature dependence of methane emissions](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/3325/2023/), and evaluating the [sensitivity of the global methane budget to atmospheric oxidation](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/3325/2023/).
