title: "Inverse Modeling"

As the volume of new observations explodes, advancing the state of inverse methodology is crucial for full exploitation of these data. Our work evaluates the impact of model transport error for the accuracy of methane source inversions and develop [new inversion formalisms](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/7775/2021/) for improved identifications of missing greenhouse gas sources from space.
